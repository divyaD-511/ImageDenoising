IMAGE DENOISING 

          Digital images are often corrupted by noise during acquisition or transmission, which degrades their quality and affects subsequent analysis. 
          This project aims to build a deep learning model to restore clean images from their noisy counterparts. 
          A CNN-based denoising autoencoder will be constructed using TensorFlow and Keras.
          The model will be trained in Google Colab to take a noisy image as input and output a denoised version of the image.
